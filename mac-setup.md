# Getting ready for Xamarin University with a Mac

Welcome to Xamarin University! This guide is to help you get your macOS development environment setup and ready to go before working through any of the Xamarin University materials. This will likely take at least an hour to complete so give yourself plenty of time to setup and validate your system.

If you have any trouble, the final half of <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/classes/track/all#xam101-setup">XAM101 - Orientation and Welcome</a> is devoted to 1:1 time with a trainer to solve setup issues. Just enroll in one of the upcoming classes and then you can get specific help from an expert.

In addition, we have a [XAM101 FAQ](https://university.xamarin.com/faq/xam101-setup) which answers some common questions about setup and Xamarin University.

## Hardware
Apple generally requires that you run the latest released version of macOS. As of Fall 2016, you should plan to get a Mac that can run El Capitan and is on the supported list for macOS Sierra. The machine should have a 64-bit Intel processor, 10GBs of free disk space, and a minimum of 4G of RAM; the more RAM the better. Avoid computers made prior to 2008 as they will likely not be sufficient to run the tools on.

### Officially supported machine list for macOS Sierra
The following machines are supported by Apple for running the latest macOS version.

- iMac – all models from late 2009, iMac 10,1 – 17,1
- MacBook – all models from late 2009, MacBook  6,1 – 9,1
- MacBook Pro – all models from 2010, MacBook Pro 7,1 – 11,5
- MacBookAir – all models from 2010, MacBook Air 3,1 – 7,2
- Mac Mini – all models from 2010, Mac Mini 4,1 – 7,1
- Mac Pro – all models from 2010, Mac Pro 5,1 – 6,1

The number presented here is the model identifier, you can retrieve that on the Mac using:

`Apple Menu > About This Mac > System Report … Model Identifier`

You can also retrieve the model information from a terminal session:

`system_profiler SPHardwareDataType`

## Step-by-step instructions

The Xamarin documentation portal has [detailed setup and install instructions](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/installation/) for Xamarin.

We also have a [macOS setup video available](http://xamarin.wistia.com/medias/rab4beeawx) which walks you through the steps to installing Xamarin on your development machine.

**Here's the basics:**

1.  Verify that your Mac is running the _latest_ released version of macOS. You can get this information from **About This Mac** in the system menu as shown above.

2. Make sure you have at least 40-50G of free disk space. The IDE, simulator and emulator images and associated SDKs are all quite large.

3.  Install the latest version of [XCode from the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

4. Launch Xcode to accept the licensing agreements and download additional runtime files necessary for development.

5. Install **Xamarin Studio** using the Xamarin unified installer available from [xamarin.com/download](http://xamarin.com/download). The installer will automatically include any tools and SDKs needed for Android development. This may take a while depending on what is already installed on the computer since it may have to download fairly large SDKs.

6. Launch **Xamarin Studio** - it will be in your **Applications** folder, or you can use Spotlight to locate and launch the application. We recommend keeping it in your Dock for quick access.

7. (Optional) If you have a MSDN license, you can activate your copy of Xamarin Studio to enable the additional features included with the commercial license. You will need a [Xamarin account](https://store.xamarin.com/account/register). This is not required - you can participate in all of the classes using the free community version of Xamarin Studio.

### Xamarin update channels

In order to keep up with the rapidly changing mobile landscape, Xamarin updates the development platform quite frequently. There are three update channels available with Xamarin:

* **Alpha** - this is used for very new changes and features and is updated fairly frequently. Changes released here have passed internal unit tests but may have breaking changes and bugs.
* **Beta** - this channel is used for imminent release updates. The code released here has been more fully tested and new API names and types are considered stable but the implementation might be changed as bugs are located and fixed.
* **Stable** - this is the production release channel. Unless otherwise noted in the course materials or by the instructor, this is the channel we assume students will be on.  

You can check or change which channel you are on using the **Xamarin Studio \> Check For Updates** system menu option at any time.

## Running mobile applications

As you design, build and run your applications, you will want to test them locally before making them available to the world. You have two choices for local testing:

1. Testing with a physical device
2. Testing on a simulated device

We recommend using physical devices when possible - these provide the best testing experience that will be as close to what your users will see. However, you likely don't have every possible variation of hardware and software available to test on, so you will need to turn to simulators and emulators to fully test your applications.

Just always keep in mind that simultors and emulators are not the real thing - they often will be faster than a physical device (because they are running on your computer's hardware), don't expose all the features available (Bluetooth, NFC, etc.), and sometimes even use different runtime environments. Just because it runs on a simulator/emulator doesn't mean your app runs correctly on a real device - always test on both.

### Testing with an iOS Device

You can run your applications on a physical iOS device plugged into your
Mac using a USB cable. You must first configure the device for
development purposes. The easiest way to do this is to use XCode – we
have a [video tutorial on how to do this with your device.](https://university.xamarin.com/lightninglectures/setting-up-an-ios-device-for-deployment)[](https://university.xamarin.com/lightninglectures/setting-up-an-ios-device-for-deployment)

### Testing with the iOS Simulator

The iOS Simulator is included as part of XCode and will be automatically launched by Xamarin Studio when you select a simulated device from the Xamarin Studio toolbar. You can choose which simulator to launch (iPhone vs. iPad, and iPhone variations) through this toolbar along the top of your Xamarin Studio IDE window:

![](media/xs-simulator.png)

By default, only the latest simulator is installed by Xcode, however you can also install other versions by launching Xcode and using the **Preferences > Components** dialog.

![](media/xcode-components.png)

This is particularly important as Apple releases new versions of iOS; the simulator is not updated automatically - so you will need to use this dialog to install _newer_ versions of iOS devices on your Mac.

### Testing with an Android device

As mentioned above, it's recommended that you use a physical Android device for testing. This is often easier to setup, and gives a more realistic view of the end-user experience. The device must be plugged into your Mac through a USB cable and be setup for **USB debugging**. On Android KitKat (4.4) and above this requires a few steps. 

> Note that on some devices, the steps might vary slightly - if they don't match the instructions below, try searching for your specific vendor and turning on device debugging.

- On the device, open **Settings\> About\> Software Information\> More**.
- Tap **Build number** seven times to enable Developer options. On the seventh tap, it will display “You are now a developer!”

![](media/android-developer.png)

- Go back to the **Settings** menu and now you'll be able to see a “Developer options” menu item.

- Tap it and turn on USB Debugging from the menu on the next screen. When you connect it to the computer, it will prompt you to allow USB debugging – make sure to check the **Always allow from this computer** to avoid the prompt in the future.

![](media/android-developer-options.png)

### Testing with Android emulators

You can also use an emulator to test Android applications. We recommend
the Android SDK emulators which are installed with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). These are hardware accelerated, kept up to date by Google and you can download images which have Google Play services pre-installed.

- Download and run the [Android Studio installer](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). It will install all the required Android development pieces as well as the emulators.

- Once installed, run the application and click the **Configure** button at the bottom of the Welcome Screen. Select **SDK Manager** from the drop down.

![](media/as-welcome.png)

- Make sure all the **Android SDK Tools** are installed for latest released Android Platform. Generally, you should always build your app with the latest SDK tools.

- Make sure you have the **SDK Platform** installed for the most recent released version of Android. There are multiple versions of the SDK available - these are the libraries used by the build process to access the Java APIs in your Android applications. At a minimum, you should install the latest released version (not previews) but adding additional versions won't hurt anything (beyond using disk space).

![](media/android-sdks.png)

> Note that you do _not_ need to install an SDK version to make your app compatible with that version - Android supplies backward-compatible libraries to ensure it runs on older versions as long as you are compiling against the latest.

- Switch to the SDK Tools tab and make sure that all of the extra SDK elements are installed. You won’t need most of this for the classes you take, but as you get further into Xamarin.Android development, more of this becomes a requirement.

![](media/android-sdk-tools.png)

#### Create at least one modern Android Virtual Device

It's recommended to have at least one modern (V5, 6 or 7) Android Virtual Device (AVD) defined. You will want to test on each Android version you can run on to ensure your app works properly on each target. The most common variation is a phone form-factor, but if you are building for tablets, you can choose a larger emulated device as well.

Unfortunately, the AVD dialog is only available in an active project, so to access the wizard, you will need to generate a new project with Android Studio.

- Click **OK** to dismiss the SDK dialog if it’s still open and return to the Welcome Screen. If you rebooted your computer, then re-open Android Studio.

- Create a new Android project by clicking the **Start a New Android Project** link on the Welcome Screen.

![](media/as-new-project.png)

- Go through the wizard dialog and generate a blank Android app. It doesn’t matter what type of project it is and you won’t need to compile it – but the emulator options are only available from the IDE window. You can delete the project once we are finished configuring the emulators.

![](media/as-new-project-wiz.png)

- Once the IDE is showing, click the **AVD button** in the toolbar – it will have a tooltip if you have trouble finding it.

![](media/as-avd-button.png)

- This will display the Android Virtual Device Manager where you can add, remove and edit your emulators. Click the **Create Virtual Device...** button at the bottom to create a new emulator.

![](media/as-avd-dialog.png)

- Next, walk through the wizard to create an emulator image – we recommend you do this twice so you have both a phone and tablet image.

![](media/as-create-avd.png)

- You can click the **Advanced** button on the emulator settings screen to get to additional settings.

![](media/as-avd-advanced.png)

- Click **Finish** to create the image. Once it’s created, it will be available to Xamarin Studio through the devices dropdown, however any editing or changes to the image definition should always be done through this Android Studio UI rather than the UI included with the Android SDK as they can sometimes overwrite each other and cause issues.

## Verify your installation

To validate your Xamarin installation on a Mac, we will use Xamarin Studio to create a new **Xamarin.Forms** application and then run it on both iOS and Android to check both environments. 

Start by creating a new Xamarin.Forms project. Open Xamarin Studio and use the New Project wizard: **File \> New Solution \> Multiplatform \> App \> Forms App** (Note: the newest versions of Xamarin Studio use the term “Multiplatform” here while previous versions used “Cross-platform”). You will use this to test your setup and make sure you can build and run both iOS and Android applications.

![](media/xs-new-app.png)

### Testing iOS on OS X with Xamarin Studio

- Make sure the iOS platform project is the current startup project in the IDE – it should be in **bold** in the solution pad. You can right-click and choose *Set As Startup Project* to change it if necessary.

- Select the **Debug** configuration and one of the **iOS Simulator** choices in the toolbar, for example the **iPhone 6s iOS 9.3** choice:

![](media/xs-ios-simulator.png)

- Click the "Run" button in the toolbar (looks like a "Play" icon).
- It should build the application and then run it in the simulator and display some text.

### Testing Xamarin.Android on OS X with Xamarin Studio

- Make sure the **Android** platform project is the active project in Xamarin Studio (you can right-click and choose *Set As Startup Project* to change it if necessary).

- Select the **Debug** configuration and one of the choices in the emulator drop-down. If you don't see any choices, or you would like to configure the choices available, use the instructions described above.

- Click the "Run" button in the toolbar (looks like a "Play" icon). It should build the application and then run it in the selected emulator.

## Uninstalling Xamarin tools

You can uninstall Xamarin from your Mac using [these instructions](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/installation/uninstalling_xamarin/).

## Troubleshooting

Most of the time, everything will install and run smoothly. However, if you have trouble with any of the steps, or you find that you cannot build or run the test application, check out our [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting).
